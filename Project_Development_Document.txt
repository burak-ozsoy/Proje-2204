- Development Platform and Group Collaboration -

Platform Used:

The code for the networked peer-to-peer chat application was developed primarily on a Windows platform using Python 3.x.

Challenges Faced:

Networking Setup: Configuring the network settings for local area network communication posed initial challenges, especially in handling broadcast messages.
Encryption Implementation: Implementing secure communication with encryption using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm required understanding cryptographic concepts and libraries.
Thread Synchronization: Coordinating multiple threads for peer discovery, chat initiation, and response required careful synchronization to avoid race conditions.

Group Members and Workload Division:



Collaboration:

Communication: Regular meetings were held to discuss progress, share insights, and resolve any issues encountered during development.
Code Review: Each team member reviewed and provided feedback on the code written by others to ensure consistency and quality.
Testing: Comprehensive testing was conducted by each member individually and then collectively to ensure the application's functionality and stability.

Overall, the collaborative efforts of the team facilitated the successful development of the networked peer-to-peer chat application, overcoming challenges and dividing workload efficiently.
